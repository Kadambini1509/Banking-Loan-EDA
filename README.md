# Loan Credit EDA
**Problem Statement**
- This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their
installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount
of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the
consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using
EDA is the aim of this case study.

  - Handling outliers

- Univariate and Bivariate analysis using categorical and numerical columns
  - Plotting various visualization plots for different columns(taking single column at once as well as taking multiple columns) vs the target variable

- Derived metrics
  - Dividing continuous features into bins to make the analysis appropriate an meaningful
